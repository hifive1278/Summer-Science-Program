# Summer-Science-Program

Specific research contributions: Program the Method of Gauss formula (Python) and animate asteroid orbit (using VPython); 
reduce observing images using SAOImageDS9/AstroImageJ and determine asteroid's equatorial coordinates and R-band magnitude; 
code Monte Carlo simulation to calculate uncertainty of produced orbital elements and compare to those generated by JPL
Horizons

Research mentor: Dr. William Andersen, Associate Academic Director (Summer Science Program), Prof. of Physics (Eastern New Mexico
University, Portales)
